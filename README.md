### How I did it

I needed to monitor my Raspberry Pi web server somehow and thought it would be a fun project to design and develop my own dashboard. Starting by design the UI in Figma I later moved on to choosing Vue and Vue CLI as the perfect framework for this type of app. 

It took me about a month from design to code and later my first published build. It took me another month to avoid the CORS-check that most modern Web browsers these days have but I got around it.

### CORS

As I mentioned above, CORS is always going to happen when you fetch from different servers and URLs. What I finally did was to actually create my own Node Express-server (I had never worked with Node before) and ran every endpoint URL through the same server as the app was hosted on and managed to avoid CORS.

### Built With

* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [EndRPi](https://endrpi.io/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Node Express](https://expressjs.com/)

## Usage

You are free to fork, share and devour this project as much as you want. I believe in sharing for the masses but since this a local app only, exposing open endopoints to a public URL is never a good idea, don't expect it to work outside your own Wifi. The EndRPi-package is easy to install and manage and there are plenty of guides on how to avoid CORS correctly.
